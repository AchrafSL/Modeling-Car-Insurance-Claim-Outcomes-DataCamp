# Modeling Car Insurance Claim Outcomes

This project builds a predictive model for On the Road car insurance to identify which customers are likely to make a claim during their policy period. Given the company's limited machine learning infrastructure, the goal is to find the **single most predictive feature** that delivers the highest model accuracy. The analysis uses logistic regression on a cleaned customer dataset to determine the optimal simple model for potential deployment.

This project was completed using DataCamp‚Äôs Datalab environment.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Load and explore customer data related to car insurance claims
- Handle missing values in key variables
- Train individual logistic regression models using **each feature separately**
- Evaluate model performance by **accuracy**, calculated using a **confusion matrix**
- Identify the **single best-performing feature** for predicting insurance claims
